        <li><strong>1915</strong> - When Mustafa Kemal was in Sofia, the First World War broke out.
             He was made Commander of the Anafartalar Group on 8th of August. This was when the
              Allied landings in the Dardanelles (today's Canakkale Strait) took place and
               he personally saved the situation in Gallipoli. During the battle,

              or captured on the 30th of August at Dumlupinar. The enemy Commander-in-Chief, General Trikupis, was captured.
               Or the 9th of September 1922 the fleeing enemy forces were driven into the sea near Izmir. The Turkish forces, under the
                extraordinary military skills of Kemal Atatürk, fought a War of Independence against the occupying Allied powers and won
                 victories on every front all over the country.</li>

         Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and Mehmets to us where they lie
          side by side here in this country of ours. You, the mothers, who sent their sons from far away countries
           wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their
            lives on this land they have become our sons as well.”</p>
